# Churn_exploration

The goal of this project was to explore the Churn dataset and build a machine learning model that classify which customer the customers. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and it contains information about the customers of a telecom company. The dataset contains 7043 rows and 21 columns. The dataset was cleaned and prepared for the model. The model was built using scikit learn and XGBoost library. Then I have verified the model using various metrics (recall ,precison ,SHAP values).
